Feature: Created Smart Contracts
    Create a smart contract for each of the languages supported

    Scenario Outline: Create a smart contract
        Given a <language> smart contract for <assetType> assets with the name <name> and version <version>
        And the contract hasn't been created already
        When I create the contract
        Then a new contract directory should exist
        Examples:
        | language   | assetType | name               | version |
        | JavaScript | Conga     | JavaScriptContract | 0.0.1   |
        | TypeScript | Conga     | TypeScriptContract | 0.0.1   |
        | Java       | Conga     | JavaContract       | 0.0.1   |
        | Go         | null      | GoContract         | 0.0.1   |
