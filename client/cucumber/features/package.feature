Feature: Packaged Smart Contracts
    Test a smart contract can be packaged in all the languages supported

    Scenario Outline: Package a smart contract
        Given a <language> smart contract for <assetType> assets with the name <name> and version <version>
        And the contract has been created
        When I package the contract
        Then a new package should be created with the name <name> and verison <version>
        And there should be a tree item with a label '<packagedName>' in the 'Smart Contracts' panel
        And the tree item should have a tooltip equal to '<packagedName>'
        Examples:
        | language   | assetType | name               | packagedName             | version |
        | JavaScript | Conga     | JavaScriptContract | JavaScriptContract@0.0.1 | 0.0.1   |
        | TypeScript | Conga     | TypeScriptContract | TypeScriptContract@0.0.1 | 0.0.1   |
        | Java       | Conga     | JavaContract       | JavaContract@0.0.1       | 0.0.1   |
        | Go         | null      | GoContract         | GoContract@0.0.1         | 0.0.1   |
