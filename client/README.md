<!---Short description of what the extension allows the user to do and key features in bullet points below 
--->
The IBM Blockchain Platform extension has been created to assist users in developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts; including connecting to Hyperledger Fabric environments.

## Requirements

You will need the following installed in order to start a local Hyperledger Fabric runtime from within the extension:
- [Node v8.x or greater and npm v5.x or greater](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

- [Yeoman (yo) v2.x](http://yeoman.io/)
- [Docker version v17.06.2-ce or greater](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)
- [Docker Compose v1.14.0 or greater](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

You can check your installed versions by running the following commands from a terminal:
- `node --version`
- `npm --version`
- `yo --version`
- `docker --version`
- `docker-compose --version`


## Features
The IBM Blockchain Platform extension provides an explorer and commands accessible from the Command Palette, for developing smart contracts quickly:

## Connecting to your own Hyperledger Fabric instance

Using this extension, you can connect to a pre-configured local instance of Hyperledger Fabric named `local_fabric`, or you can connect to your own Hyperledger Fabric instance. If you choose to connect to your own Hyperledger Fabric instance, it must be running Hyperledger Fabric v1.3.0 or later.

**When using the pre-configured local instance of Hyperledger Fabric named `local_fabric`, the extension will automatically pull and use the correct Docker images.**

If you want to start and connect to your own Hyperledger Fabric instance, ensure that you are using Hyperledger Fabric v1.3.0 or later by following the Fabric documentation here:

https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/v1.3.0-rc1/install.html

## Supported Operating Systems 

Linux and Mac OS are currently the only supported operating systems for use with the extension.

The work to implement Windows support can be tracked in [Issue 72](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/blockchain-vscode-extension/issues/72).


## Telemetry Reporting

The extension uses telemetry reporting to track usage data and help improve future extension versions.

For instructions on how to disable telemetry reporting, please visit the visit the [Visual Studio Code FAQ](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/FAQ#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting).
