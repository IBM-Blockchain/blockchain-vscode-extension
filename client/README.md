If you have find any problems or want to make suggestions for future features please create [issues and suggestions on Github](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/blockchain-vscode-extension/issues)

## Requirements

You will need the following installed in order to start a local Hyperledger Fabric runtime from within the extension:
- [Node v8.x or greater and npm v5.x or greater](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Yeoman (yo) v2.x](http://yeoman.io/)
- [Docker version v17.06.2-ce or greater](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)
- [Docker Compose v1.14.0 or greater](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

If you are using Windows, you must also ensure the following:
- Your version of Windows supports Hyper-V and Docker:
  - Windows 10 Enterprise, Pro, or Education with 1607 Anniversary Update or later
- Docker for Windows is configured to use Linux containers (this is the default)
- You have installed the C++ Build Tools for Windows from [windows-build-tools](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools#windows-build-tools)
- You have installed OpenSSL v1.0.2 from [Win32 OpenSSL](http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)
  - Install the normal version, not the version marked as "light"
  - Install the Win32 version into `C:\OpenSSL-Win32` on 32-bit systems
  - Install the Win64 version into `C:\OpenSSL-Win64` on 64-bit systems

You can check your installed versions by running the following commands from a terminal:
- `node --version`
- `npm --version`
- `yo --version`
- `docker --version`
- `docker-compose --version`


## Features

## Connecting to your own Hyperledger Fabric instance

Using this extension, you can connect to a pre-configured local instance of Hyperledger Fabric named `local_fabric`, or you can connect to your own Hyperledger Fabric instance. If you choose to connect to your own Hyperledger Fabric instance, it must be running Hyperledger Fabric v1.3.0 or later.

**When using the pre-configured local instance of Hyperledger Fabric named `local_fabric`, the extension will automatically pull and use the correct Docker images.**

If you want to start and connect to your own Hyperledger Fabric instance, ensure that you are using Hyperledger Fabric v1.3.0 or later by following the Fabric documentation here:

https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.3/install.html

## Supported Operating Systems 

Linux, Mac OS, and Windows are currently the only supported operating systems for use with the extension.

## Telemetry Reporting

The extension uses telemetry reporting to track usage data and help improve future extension versions.

For instructions on how to disable telemetry reporting, please visit the visit the [Visual Studio Code FAQ](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/FAQ#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting).
