# IBM Blockchain Platform Extension translations

To provide translate versions of externalised strings in the VSCode extension requires localized JSON files which should be placed in this directory.

For information regarding the required format and directory layout, see:

- [Microsoft vscode-nls-dev project](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-nls-dev)
- [Microsoft i18n-sample vscode extension sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/i18n-sample)

For information on how strings should be externalised, see:

- [Microsoft vscode-nls project](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-nls)

**Note:** since very few strings have been externalised yet, and none of those have been translated, there is currently no step in the build process that would process these files and include them in the packaged extension.
