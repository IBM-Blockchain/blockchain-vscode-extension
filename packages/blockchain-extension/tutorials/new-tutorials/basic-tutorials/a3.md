## **Tutorial A3: Deploying a smart contract**

---

Estimated time: `10 minutes`

Now that we've created our first smart contract, we'd like to try it out. In this tutorial we will:

* Start an instance of Hyperledger Fabric in the local workspace
* Package the smart contract we previously created
* Deploy the smart contract to the running Hyperledger Fabric

In order to successfully complete this tutorial, you must have first completed tutorial <a href='./a2.md'>A2: Creating a smart contract</a>. The project must be active in your VS Code workspace.

<img src="./images/bullet.png" alt="[]"></img> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A3.1`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Expand the first section below to get started.

<summary><b>Start the VS Code Hyperledger Fabric environment</b></summary>

<img src="./images/bullet.png" alt="[]"></img> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A3.2`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Click on the IBM Blockchain Platform icon in the activity bar to show the blockchain sidebar.

<br><h3 align='left'>The Fabric Environments view</h3>

The IBM Blockchain Platform VS Code Extension helps you test your smart contracts in a Hyperledger Fabric network. The extension comes with a pre-configured one organization network that runs on your local machine, and you can connect to remote networks too.

The available networks are shown in the Fabric Environments view.

<img src="./images/a3.3.1.png" alt="Fabric Environments view"></img>

We'll see later how this view also allows you to configure more realistic networks that also run entirely on your local machine. This allows you to check that your smart contract is functionally correct before you move to a more complex distributed network configuration. 

The required Hyperledger Fabric components are automatically downloaded and started by the tool itself.

<img src="./images/bullet.png" alt="[]"></img> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A3.3`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the Fabric Environments view, click "*1 Org Local Fabric  O  (click to start)*"

This will download and start the embedded instance of Hyperledger Fabric, and may take up to five minutes to complete.

<img src="./images/a3.3.2.png" alt="Local Fabric starting"></img>

When Hyperledger Fabric has fully initialized, the view will change to show the smart contracts, channels, nodes and organizations in the local environment.

<img src="./images/a3.3.3.png" alt="Local Fabric started"></img>

Each of these elements tell you what's configured in the connected environment:
* **Smart contracts** show the smart contracts that are available. They can be *installed*, which means that the code has been copied to the peers, and *instantiated*, which means that they are running.
* **Channels** define the scope of each network, and form one method of choosing how organizations share data. We will look at channels in a later tutorial.
* **Nodes** are the Hyperledger Fabric components that make the system work. There are three types of nodes: peers (which run ledgers and execute smart contracts), orderers (which assert transaction order and distribute blocks to peers), and certificate authorities (which provide the means of identifying users and organizations on the network).
* **Organizations** are the members of the blockchain network. Each organization can consist of many users.

If you expand the various sections you'll the various defaults for each of these elements:

* By default there are no **smart contracts** installed or instantiated.
* There is a single default **channel** called *mychannel*.
* There are four **nodes**: a single peer called *Org1Peer1*, an ordering node called *Orderer* and a certificate authories for each of the two default organizations.
* Two **organizations**: one for the peer (*Org1MSP*) and one for the orderer (*OrdererMSP*). It is good practice to use separate organizations for the orderer nodes and peers.

   > <b>Starting again?</b>
   > <br> If you ever need to start with a new Hyperledger Fabric instance, hover over the Fabric Environments view, click the ellipsis ('...') and select 'Teardown Fabric Environment'. Use with caution: this will completely wipe the Hyperledger Fabric instance and anything deployed to it. Development files in your workspace (e.g. smart contract projects) will remain.

<summary><b>Package, install and instantiate the smart contract</b></summary>


We will now package, install and instantiate our smart contract into the local environment. It is possible to do this as three separate actions in VS Code, or by just using the 'Instantiate' action, which will also do the package and install steps if necessary.

For simplicity, we will just use the single-step instantiate for now. When we explore the upgrade process in tutorial <a href='./a6.md'>A6: Upgrading a smart contract</a>, we will split this process up.

<img src="./images/bullet.png" alt="[]"></img> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A3.5`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the Fabric Environments view, click "Smart Contracts" -> "Instantiated" -> "+ Instantiate".

<img src="./images/a3.5.png" alt="Instantiate smart contract"></img>

IBM Blockchain Platform detects the smart contract project created in the previous tutorial.

<img src="./images/bullet.png" alt="[]"></img> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A3.6`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the Command Palette, click 'DemoContract'.

<img src="./images/a3.6.png" alt="Choose the package to install"></img>

It may take up to a minute to package and install the smart contract.

Before the smart contract is instantiated you will be prompted to enter the name of any required instantiation function.

<img src="./images/bullet.png" alt="[]"></img> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A3.7`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the Command Palette, press Enter when prompted for an instantiate function name.

<img src="./images/a3.7.png" alt="Enter any instantiation function"></img>

Private data is an advanced technique for sharing data between organizations. We will not be using that feature for now; it is the subject of a later tutorial.

<img src="./images/bullet.png" alt="[]"></img> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A3.8`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the Command Palette, click 'No' to not provide a private data collection configuration file.

<img src="./images/a3.8-a6.16.png" alt="No Private Data Collection configuration file"></img>

The endorsement policy determines which peers get to run the smart contract. As we only have one peer in our organization, we can accept the default.

<img src="./images/bullet.png" alt="[]"></img> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A3.9`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the Command Palette, click 'Default' to accept the default smart contract endorsement policy.

<img src="./images/a3.9.1-a6.17.1.png" alt="Default endorsement policy"></img>

Instantiation may take a further few minutes to complete.

When instantiation has completed you will see the new smart contract package listed in the Smart Contracts view, and also underneath the Instantiated section of the connected environment.

<img src="./images/a3.9.2.png" alt="Smart contract view after instantiate"></img>

<img src="./images/a3.9.3.png" alt="Fabric environments view after instantiate"></img>

The text after the '@' sign is the version; note that it is set to '0.0.1'. For TypeScript smart contracts, both the name and version are taken from the <i>package.json</i> file in the root of the smart contract project:

<img src="./images/a3.9.4.png" alt="Top of package.json"></img>

We will update this in a later tutorial.

<br><h3 align='left'>Summary</h3>

In this tutorial we started the built-in one organization Hyperledger Fabric network. We packaged our smart contract, installed it and instantiated it.

In the next tutorial we will exercise the smart contract, to see how it behaves inside the network.
