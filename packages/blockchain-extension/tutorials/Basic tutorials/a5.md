## **Tutorial A5: Invoking a smart contract from an external application**

---

Estimated time: `45 minutes`

In the last tutorial we learned about gateways and wallets and how they are used to provide our entry point into a Hyperledger Fabric network. We also used the IBM Blockchain Platform VS Code extension to connect to our network and call some transactions. In this tutorial we will:

* Build a new TypeScript application that can interact with Hyperledger Fabric
* Run the application to submit a transaction
* Modify the application and test the changes

In order to successfully complete this tutorial, you must have first completed tutorial <a href='./a4.md'>A4: Invoking a smart contract from VS Code</a> in the active workspace.

<details>
<summary><b>Export the network details</b></summary>


When we build our application we will need to tell it how to connect to our Hyperledger Fabric network. To do this, we need to export two things from VS Code:
* the peer connection details
* the wallet containing our identity

We will start by exporting our connection details into a file called a *connection profile*.

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.2`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With the gateway connected, move the mouse over the Fabric Gateways view, click the ellipsis that appears and select "Export Connection Profile".

![alt text](./images/a5.2.png "Export connection profile")

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.3`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Create a new folder called 'DemoApplication' as a peer of the DemoContract project we created earlier. Give the connection profile a convenient name ('connection.json') and export it into the new folder.

![alt text](./images/a5.3.png "New application")

We will now export our wallet.

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.4`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the Fabric Wallets view, right-click on "1 Org Local Fabric - Org1 Wallet" and select "Export Wallet".

Take care not to click on the Orderer organization's wallet by mistake.

![alt text](./images/a5.4.png "Export Wallet")

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.5`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Select the 'DemoApplication' folder and click Export to save the wallet as 'Org1'.

![alt text](./images/a5.5.png "Export Wallet file dialog")

<summary><b>Create the external application</b></summary>

We will now load the DemoApplication folder into VS Code for editing.


![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.7`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
From the VS Code menu bar click "File" -> "Add Folder to Workspace..."

![alt text](./images/a5.7.png "Add folder to workspace")

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.8`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Highlight the 'DemoApplication' folder and click 'Add'.

![alt text](./images/a5.8.1.png "DemoApplication folder")

After adding the folder to the workspace, VS Code will show the Explorer sidebar, with the new 'DemoApplication' folder underneath 'DemoContract'.

![alt text](./images/a5.8.2.png "Explorer sidebar")

In order to build a working Typescript application we will now create three files in addition to the wallet and connection profile we exported earlier:
* **invoke.ts**: The Typescript file that is the implementation of our application: the logic to connect to the Hyperledger Fabric network and call transactions.
* **tsconfig.json**: Describes the TypeScript compiler options, including source and destination locations
* **package.json**: Describes the Node modules we require (including the Hyperledger Fabric client SDK), as well as the listing the various commands we will use to build and test.

We will start by creating *invoke.ts* inside a *src* folder.


![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.9`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Right-click 'DemoApplication' and select 'New Folder'.

![alt text](./images/a5.9.png "Add src folder")

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.10`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Name the folder 'src'.

![alt text](./images/a5.10.png "Name src")

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.11`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Right-click 'src' and select 'New File'.

![alt text](./images/a5.11.png "Add invoke.ts file")

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.12`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Name the file '**invoke.ts**'.

![alt text](./images/a5.12.png "Name invoke.ts")

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.13`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the editor view for the new invoke.ts file, copy and paste the following text. (The contents are also <a href="./resources/invoke.ts">available here</a>).

```typescript
import { FileSystemWallet, Gateway } from 'fabric-network';
import * as path from 'path';

const ccpPath = path.resolve(__dirname, '..', 'connection.json');

async function main() {
    try {

        // Create a new file system based wallet for managing identities.
        const walletPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'Org1');
        const wallet = new FileSystemWallet(walletPath);
        console.log(`Wallet path: ${walletPath}`);

        // Create a new gateway for connecting to our peer node.
        const gateway = new Gateway();
        await gateway.connect(ccpPath, { wallet, identity: 'org1Admin', discovery: { enabled: true, asLocalhost: true } });

        // Get the network (channel) our contract is deployed to.
        const network = await gateway.getNetwork('mychannel');

        // Get the contract from the network.
        const contract = network.getContract('DemoContract');

        // Submit the specified transaction.
        await contract.submitTransaction('createMyAsset', '002', 'Night Watch');
        console.log(`Transaction has been submitted`);

        // Disconnect from the gateway.
        await gateway.disconnect();

    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Failed to submit transaction: ${error}`);
        process.exit(1);
    }
}
main();
```

Your file should be 36 lines long. We will look through what the application is doing later on in this tutorial. 

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.14`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Save the file ('File' -> 'Save').

Saving the file will change the tab for the editor to show a cross; a solid circle here means that you have unsaved changes.

![alt text](./images/a5.13.png "Saved file")

You will see various errors reported by VS Code, because we have not yet configured the set of external dependencies. 

![alt text](./images/a5.14.png "Compilation errors")

We will next create the *tsconfig.json* file.

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.15`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Right-click 'DemoApplication' (NOT 'src') and select 'New File'.

![alt text](./images/a5.15.png "Add tsconfig.json file")

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.16`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Name the file '**tsconfig.json**'.

![alt text](./images/a5.16.png "Name tsconfig.json")

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.17`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the editor view for the new tsconfig.json file, copy and paste the following text. (The contents are also <a href="./resources/tsconfig.json">available here</a>).

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
      "target": "es6",
      "module": "commonjs",
      "allowJs": true,
      "sourceMap": true,
      "outDir": "./dist/",
      "strict": true,
      "noImplicitAny": true,
      "strictNullChecks": true,
      "strictFunctionTypes": true,
      "strictBindCallApply": true,
      "strictPropertyInitialization": true,
      "noImplicitThis": true,
      "alwaysStrict": true,
      "esModuleInterop": true,
      "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
    },
    "include": [
      "./src/**/*"
    ],
    "exclude": [
      "node_modules"
    ]
}  
```

Your file should be 25 lines long.

Importantly, the tsconfig.json file specifies the source and output folders (src and dist respectively), and enables compiler options for strict syntax checking of our Typescript.


![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.18`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Save the file ('File' -> 'Save').

Finally, we will create the *package.json* file.

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.19`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Right-click 'DemoApplication' (NOT 'src') and select 'New File'.

![alt text](./images/a5.19.png "Add package.json file")

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.20`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Name the file '**package.json**'.

![alt text](./images/a5.20.png "Name package.json")

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.21`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the editor view for the new package.json file, copy and paste the following text. (The contents are also <a href="./resources/package.json">available here</a>).

```json
{
    "name": "demoapplication",
    "version": "1.0.0",

    },
    "nyc": {

        "branches": 100,
        "functions": 100,
        "lines": 100
    }
}
```

Your file should be 60 lines long. It describes the module dependencies of our application, including any required versions.

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.22`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Save the file ('File' -> 'Save').

At this stage, your application structure should contain a wallet folder ('Org1'), a source folder ('src') which contains a single file ('invoke.ts'), a connection profile ('connection.json'), package.json and tsconfig.json. If this is not the case, check the instructions and move and edit files as necessary.

![alt text](./images/a5.22.png "DemoApplication folder structure")


In the next section we will build the application.

<details>
<summary><b>Build the external application</b></summary>

Even though we've specified our application's dependencies inside package.json, we haven't yet loaded the required modules into our workspace and so errors remain. The next step is to install these modules so that the errors disappear and allow our application to be built and run.

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.24`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Right-click 'DemoApplication' and select 'Open in Terminal'.

![alt text](./images/a5.24.1.png "Open in Terminal")

This will bring to focus a terminal prompt inside VS Code.

![alt text](./images/a5.24.2.png "VS Code Terminal")

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.25`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the terminal window type ``npm install`` and press Enter.

![alt text](./images/a5.25.1.png "npm install running")

This will download the module dependencies into our project folder and may take a minute or so to complete. When it has finished, the prompt will return.

![alt text](./images/a5.25.2.png "npm install finished")

The errors that were previously reported will now all vanish, and the DemoApplication folder will now contain a new 'node_modules' folder that contains the imported dependencies.

![alt text](./images/a5.25.3.png "No editor errors")

With our dependencies resolved we can now build our application.

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.26`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the main VS Code menu, click 'Terminal' -> 'Run Build Task...'.

![alt text](./images/a5.26.png "Run Build Task")

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.27`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the command palette, find and click 'tsc: watch - tsconfig.json DemoApplication'.

Take care to select the correct option as there will be similar looking alternatives (build options for our smart contract project, for example).

![alt text](./images/a5.27.1.png "tsc watch")

After a few seconds, the application will have been built and the compiler will enter *'watch'* mode, which means that any changes to the source will cause an automatic recompilation. Using watch mode is useful as it means you do not have to force a rebuild each time you make a change.

![alt text](./images/a5.27.2.png "Successful build and watch")

You will also see a new 'dist' folder underneath the DemoApplication project. This contains the built version of the application, which is what we will run in the next section.

![alt text](./images/a5.27.3.png "New 'dist' folder")

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.28`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Expand the next section to continue.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><b>Run the external application</b></summary>

We can run our application wherever we choose - it is just a standard node application. VS Code provides a useful run time environment for applications as it is integrated with the rest of the tools we have been using, and is what we will do now.

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.29`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the main VS Code menu, click 'Terminal' -> 'Run Task...'.

![alt text](./images/a5.29.png "Run Task")

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.30`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Find and select the task 'npm: start DemoApplication'.

Again, take care to select the correct task as there might be alternatives that look very similar.

![alt text](./images/a5.30.png "npm start")

VS Code will offer to automatically scan the task output for us, but we will not do that here.

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.31`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Click 'Continue without scanning the task output'.

![alt text](./images/a5.31.1.png "npm start")


The task will now run. What it will do is run the *start* script that is defined in DemoApplication's package.json, which is the command `node ./dist/invoke.js`. You could run the same node command in any appropriately configured environment and achieve the same output.

![alt text](./images/a5.31.2.png "npm start")

The task will be run inside VS Code and, after a brief pause, you will see it complete successfully.

![alt text](./images/a5.31.3.png "command output")

> <br>
    > <b>Running the command a second time?</b>
    > <br> If you run the command again you will see errors like 'The my asset 002 already exists' and 'Endorsement has failed'.
    > <br>
    > If you review the implementation of the <i>createMyAsset</i> transaction, you'll see that this is intentional. You can quickly fix this by submitting the appropriate <i>deleteMyAsset</i> transaction in the Fabric Gateways view.
> <br>&nbsp;


![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.32`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Press any key in the terminal window to free it up for other tasks.

The Terminal window will switch back to what was there previously.

<br><h3 align='left'>Reviewing the application</h3>

At this stage it is worthwhile reviewing what the application actually did.

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.33`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Click on the 'invoke.ts' tab in the VS Code editor (or load it from the Explorer view).

![alt text](./images/a5.33.png "invoke.ts")

You can see the sequence of steps in the source file. It's largely self-explanatory, but the key elements are:
1. Specify the file system location of the wallet and connection profile, which we exported previously.
2. Instantiate a Gateway object and pass to it the connection profile, an identity from the wallet and some additional connection options.
3. Select the channel (network) to work with.
4. Select the smart contract to work with.
5. Submit a transaction with a given set of parameters and wait for it to finish.
6. Disconnect from the gateway.

We will now make a small change to the external application to invoke a different transaction.

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.34`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Expand the next section of the tutorial to continue.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Modify the external application</b></summary>


To verify that the createMyAsset transaction worked correctly from within our application, we will modify the application to display the new value of the key. (Of course, it is also possible to do this from the Fabric Gateways view as it is the same blockchain instance.)

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.35`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the *invoke.ts* editor, find the lines that submit the transaction and log the success message to the console:

![alt text](./images/a5.35.png "code to submit a transaction")

Our new application will attempt to evaluate the readMyAsset transaction and display the result.

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.36`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Use copy and paste to replace these lines with the following:

```typescript
// Evaluate the specified transaction.
const result = await contract.evaluateTransaction('readMyAsset', '002');
console.log(`Transaction has been evaluated, result is: ${result.toString()}`);
```



![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.37`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Save the file ('File' -> 'Save').

As we previously enabled watch mode in the compiler, saving the file will automatically cause a recompilation of the application. This will take a few seconds.

When the modifications have been built, we can test them by running the application again.

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.38`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the main VS Code menu, click 'Terminal' -> 'Run Task...'.

![alt text](./images/a5.29.png "Run Task")

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.39`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Find and select the task 'npm: start DemoApplication'.

![alt text](./images/a5.30.png "npm start")

![alt text](./images/bullet.png "[]") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `A5.40`: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Click 'Continue without scanning the task output'.

![alt text](./images/a5.31.1.png "npm start")

The task will be run and again, after a brief pause, you will see it complete successfully.

![alt text](./images/a5.40.png "command output")

Note that the output now shows the current value of the '002' key we entered earlier.

<br><h3 align='left'>Summary</h3>

In this tutorial we have built a client application that can submit and evaluate transactions on a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain.

While the Fabric instance we've been working with is part of our VS Code environment, the same concept applies to all IBM Blockchain Platform-based blockchains: you export the wallet and connection profile for the target network and supply it to the Gateway object you instantiate in your application.

Just like we modified our client application, smart contracts can change too. In the next tutorial we will try modifying our smart contract to see how the upgrade process works.
