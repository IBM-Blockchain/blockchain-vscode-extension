<summary><b>What is blockchain?</b></summary>

The generally accepted definition of a blockchain is a <i>distributed ledger</i> with <i>smart contracts</i>.

Whenever anything changes in business, this is captured in a transaction. Transactions involve assets and will describe, for example, their movement through a business network.

Traditionally, transactions are recorded in business ledgers. Unfortunately, a transaction which involves multiple organizations will be recorded differently by each business. Periodically, these different ledgers need to be reconciled, and when tranactions don't tally disputes occur, the resolution of which can be slow and expensive.

Blockchain transactions and ledgers are different. Blockchain introduces a new kind of transaction – a multiparty transaction - that is signed by everyone involved in the transaction. Blockchain ledgers are different too; the same ledger is replicated in every organization in the network, and kept synchronized using a process called *consensus*.  Moreover, these ledgers are *immutable*; once a multi-party transaction is written to the ledger, it cannot be reversed.

These tutorials will help you understand these ideas in more detail, and how to use them in practice.

<br><h3 align='left'>Smart contracts</h3>

In business, transactions are generated according to *contracts* which define the exact conditions under which a transaction is generated. If I buy a car from you and it breaks down a month later, the terms of our contract might say that you are liable for the repair.

Blockchain introduces the idea of a *smart contract*. It describes in code what a transaction generated by the smart contract looks like. For example, a car contract might use an algorithm to check that you're the current owner of the car, and that a purchaser has the required funds. If so, then a transaction will be generated by it that represents the transfer the money between you and the purchaser and the corresponding change of ownership. 

Blockchains such as Hyperledger Fabric make it easy to write smart contracts, by maintaining the current value of every business object in a ledger. It means that smart contracts don't need to compute the effect of history of transactions that involve your car -- they simply look up the current world state of that car.  

In these tutorials we'll learn a lot more about smart contracts and how to write them.

<br><h3 align='left'>Blockchain and Bitcoin</h3>

Blockchain is commonly associated with Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency and peer-to-peer payments system. Bitcoin uses a blockchain as the ledger to record its transactions and a resource-intensive method of consensus called *proof of work*. Bitcoin favors anonymity; even though the ledger is public, it's almost impossible to determine who is behind a bitcoin transaction.

Businesses often have a different operating environment. For example, they are required to carry out Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks, which require businesses to know who they are dealing with.  This means that business blockchains require identifiable participants and favor features such as *privacy* and *confidentiality*. Knowing who's behind a transaction helps to remove incentives for fraud and as such, resource-intensive methods of consensus are not needed.

And of course, business ledgers also store more than cryptocurrency transactions; any asset of worth to a business can be transacted and logged on a business blockchain.

<summary><b>Introduction to Hyperledger Fabric</b></summary>

In early 2016, the Linux Foundation formally announced the creation of the *Hyperledger* project. Its aim continues to be to develop blockchain technologies that specifically cater for the requirements of businesses.

Hyperledger is more than a single technology; it is a collection of cross-industry frameworks and tools that come under a single open license and governance structure.

   > <br>
   > Find out more about the Hyperledger Project at <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">https://www.hyperledger.org/</a>
   > <br>&nbsp;

Hyperledger Fabric is the most widely implemented of these technologies. It provides a shared, replicated ledger implementation with support for smart contracts. It is designed as a pluggable framework so that it can evolve over time, for example as new privacy and consensus technologies emerge. It continues to be developed by hundreds of developers in the community representing dozens of different organizations.

   > Read the Hyperledger Fabric technical documentation at <a href="https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/">https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/</a>
   > <br>&nbsp;

Hyperledger Fabric underpins many of the world's most successful blockchain implementations, including <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/food-trust">IBM Food Trust</a>, <a href="https://www.tradelens.com/">TradeLens</a> and <a href="https://we-trade.com/">we.trade</a>.


<br><h3 align='left'>Hyperledger Fabric technology</h3>

A Hyperledger Fabric network consists of three key types of components:

* **Peer node**: holds a copy of the ledger and is responsible for running smart contracts.
* **Orderer node**: part of a distributed ordering service that agrees the order that transactions are added to the ledger.
* **Certificate Authority**: responsible for issuing the certificates that identify users and organizations on the network.

Each organization that joins a Hyperledger Fabric network will typically own peers and certificate authorities. There needs to be one ordering service in each network, although this can be distributed between organizations.

As we progress through these tutorials, we will work with each of these components.

<summary><b>Introduction to IBM Blockchain Platform</b></summary>

IBM Blockchain Platform is a set of tools and services that allow users to build and operate Hyperledger Fabric networks. Broadly, it consists of two main elements:

* **IBM Blockchain Platform Extension for Visual Studio Code**. This is the tool you are using now. It allows developers to create Hyperledger Fabric smart contracts and the applications that interact with them. Developers can test their applications using an embedded instance of Hyperledger Fabric, or connect to a remote Hyperledger Fabric network.

* **IBM Blockchain Platform Console**. This allows users to create and manage their Hyperledger Fabric components. The components can be run on IBM Cloud or on any OpenShift-based environment, including on-premises.

   > <br>&nbsp;

In later tutorials you will learn more about the console. For now, you will start to familiarize yourself with the IBM Blockchain Platform developer tools.

<summary><b>IBM Blockchain Platform Extension for Visual Studio Code</b></summary>

In these tutorials you will be performing actions in VS Code, so begin by ensuring that you can comfortably see both this tutorial and VS Code. If you can, arrange the tutorial on a second window ('File' -> 'New Window') and move it to a second monitor. If this is not possible, you can right-click an editor tab and select 'Split' to arrange your VS Code editors within a single window.

Let's start with the basic elements of the IBM Blockchain Platform VS Code extension:

![alt text](./images/a1.4.png "A screenshot of the VSCode Extension")

`1.` **Editor pane**: Used for editing smart contracts and application code.<br>
`2.` **The IBM Blockchain Platform icon in the VS Code sidebar**: Shows or hides the IBM Blockchain Platform sidebar.<br>
`3.` **IBM Blockchain Platform sidebar**: A set of views that show the Hyperledger Fabric resources you are working with: smart contracts, environments, gateways and wallets.<br>
`4.` **IBM Blockchain Platform home page**: At both the top and bottom of the screen are icons that allow you to return to the IBM Blockchain Platform welcome screen if you get lost.<br>
`5.` **Output**: The results of running any transaction are displayed here. Also note the neighboring tabs that allow you, among other things, to run Terminal commands in an embedded shell.<br>
`6.` **Notifications**: Timely information is displayed here, such as the results of deploying a new smart contract. If you click on the icon in the corner you can usually revisit any notifications you've missed.<br>
`7.` **Command palette**: When you tell VS Code to do something, such as package a smart contract, VS Code will invite you to enter any parameters here. You can also bring up the command palette before you invoke any command by selecting "View -> Command Palette". (All of the IBM Blockchain Platform commands start with "IBM Blockchain Platform" so if you start typing this in the command palette you can quickly filter to the command you need.)

If you're not familiar with VS Code, it's worthwhile spending a few minutes clicking around to get yourself comfortable with it. When you are ready, continue on.
