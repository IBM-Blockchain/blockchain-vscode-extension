## **Welcome to the IBM Blockchain Platform developer tutorials**

   > <br>
   > <b>Internal note for writers:</b> Check out the <a href="./styleguide.md">style guide</a> for new tutorials.
   > <br>&nbsp;

In these tutorials you will learn about Hyperledger Fabric development using IBM Blockchain Platform:
* What blockchain is all about
* Key concepts and components in Hyperledger Fabric
* Developing smart contracts and applications using IBM Blockchain Platform
* Joining an existing network
* Advanced usage of Hyperledger Fabric and IBM Blockchain Platform

As you complete the learning objectives you will be invited to gain <a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/">accredited badges</a> from IBM.

If you're new to blockchain, don't worry; we will start from complete basics and every step is fully guided.

You will find that developing for blockchain is similar to developing any other software application and as such, a familiarity with a programming language is desirable, but not essential. We will be using the TypeScript language throughout; if you're a JavaScript or Java programmer you'll find TypeScript particularly familiar.

Click on a tutorial set below to get started. We recommend starting with the Basic tutorials.

<summary><b>B. Joining a Hyperledger Fabric network</b></summary>

<p>The <i>joining a network</i> tutorials introduce you to the administration tools that underpin IBM Blockchain Platform. You will connect to an existing Hyperledger Fabric network running on IBM Blockchain Platform, and take a tour of the web console used for network management. You will then connect a VS Code application into the network and use it to submit transactions and see the results.
