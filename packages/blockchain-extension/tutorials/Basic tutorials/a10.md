<summary><b>Basic Tutorials recap</b></summary>

This set of tutorials started from complete basics and took you through the development lifecycle for blockchain applications.

Blockchain is simply the name given to a *distributed ledger*, which provides business networks the ability to share data, using cryptographic proofs to ensure that participants have identical information. This helps to engender trust in business networks and avoid costly processes such as dispute resolution.

Blockchains can be used to **share any data of value**. In these tutorials we stored simple key/value pairs that mapped unique numerical keys to pieces of artwork, but the data could have equally well been reference information, ownership details or anything else of value to the network.

A blockchain application consists of two main components. The business rules for each transaction are encapsulated in a *smart contract* which is the shared code that each endorsing peer runs. The *client application* asks the blockchain to run these transactions with a given set of input parameters.

The development process for smart contracts and client applications is similar to the development process for other software applications. The code is developed, built, tested, debugged and deployed. In these tutorials we used the tools provided by the IBM Blockchain Platform VS Code extension to go through the main tasks in this process using a locally installed Hyperledger Fabric peer.

<br><h3 align='left'>The power of the network</h3>

Using a single peer is useful for testing, but it really only telling a small part of the blockchain story.

So far we have been submitting transactions that update our local *world state* database. As this transaction data eventually maps to bytes on our disk, it is still fundamentally modifiable; it doesn't give us proof that data has not been tampered with.

What sets blockchain apart from a database - even a shared database - is the power of the network to enable tamper resistance. By distributing multiple copies of the data across a network and having different nodes agree on the contents through a process of *consensus*, it makes it unfeasible, even for administrators, to modify the data.

In the next set of tutorials we will connect to an existing network and see the power of the network in action. We will see how another tool that is part of IBM Blockchain Platform - the web console - can be used to join an network. We'll then connect both VS Code and client applications to that network and use them to run transactions that are agreed by multiple nodes on that network.
