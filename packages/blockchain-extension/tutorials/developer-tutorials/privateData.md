## **Getting Started with Private Data**
`30 - 40 minutes`

**Important:** Please ensure you have completed the Introductory series on VS Code before starting this tutorial.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what private data is and how it can be a beneficial addition to smart contracts.
- Implement private data so that you can use it in your smart contracts.

**What is private data?**

Private data is just that, data you would like to keep private. On the IBM Blockchain Platform, private data is any data about assets you would like to restrict access to; whether you want to keep it to yourself or share it with a select group of people.

**How does it work?**

Private data is stored in Private Data Collections - these are stored locally on authorized peers, and the information they contain is not visible on the World State. When a peer submits a transaction with private data, the details are written to their Private Data Collection using the transient data store, while a hash of the private data is stored on the World State for other members of the network to see. This hash acts as a permanent record that the transaction happened.

**Why not just use separate channels to keep data private?**

In many cases, users make separate channels for communicating data they would like to keep private. However, the issue with this method is that when a new member joins the network, you have a huge number of new channels to create with existing members. It also prevents you from sharing information with everyone on the network while keeping a portion of the data private. In addition to the operational overhead, bilateral channels can limit performance which is why they are not recommended - using private data collections will avoid this downside.

**Introducing the verify function**

In this tutorial you will be introduced to the verify function. This allows unauthorised peers to confirm that what's contained in the authorised peer's Private Data Collections is what they claim it to be. For example, if you bought a shiny new car and your friend Dan didn't believe you only spent £10,000 on it, he could use the data you provide on the car in a verify transaction to confirm that you did really spend that much!

So, let's get started.

<summary><b>1. Create a new smart contract project</b></summary>

Private Data Smart Contracts are available in TypeScript, Java and JavaScript, this tutorial will use TypeScript. The steps for this are very similar to those in Tutorial 1 of the Introductory Series, but here we will be choosing the Private Data Smart Contract.

> Commands can be executed from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` for Windows, `Cmd+Shift+P` for MacOS). For this extension, all commands start with `IBM Blockchain Platform:`. Throughout this tutorial, there will be side notes prompting you when an interaction can be done using the Command Palette.

1. Navigate to the __IBM Blockchain Platform__ window by selecting the corresponding icon from the icon panel on the left.

2. Hover over the `SMART CONTRACTS` panel, click the `...` menu, and select the `Create New Project` option from the dropdown.

    > Command Palette alternative: Create New Project

3. As this is a tutorial on private data, we will be using the `Private Data Contract`, so select this option.

4. An MSP ID is required for Private Data Collections. Leave it as the default `Org1MSP` for this tutorial. The sample project creates a Private Data Collection owned by a single organisation in the network and the MSP ID is used to specify which organisation.

5. Choose a smart contract language. As previously stated, this tutorial will use `TypeScript`, but feel free to choose `Java` or `JavaScript` if you would prefer to work with that.

6. The next option is whether you would like to name your private asset in the generated contract. The default is `MyPrivateAsset`, but feel free to name your asset whatever you want. However, we recommend sticking with `MyPrivateAsset` for this tutorial.

    > Pro Tip: If you decided to change the name of your asset, remember to swap `MyPrivateAsset` for your new name in future steps.

7. Choose a location to save the project. Click `Browse`, then
`New Folder` and name the project what you want e.g. `privateContract`. Make sure you avoid using spaces when you name the folder.

8. Click `Create`, select the new folder you created and click `Save`.

9. Finally, select `Add to workspace` from the options listed.

There will now be a skeleton contract in your desired language, containing your private asset. You can view your new contract by navigating to the Explorer view (the document looking icon in the left-hand icon bar), and opening `src/my-private-asset-contract.ts`.

Congratulations, you've got a Private Data Smart Contract!

<details><summary><b>2. Understand the smart contract project</b></summary>

The generated private data smart contract contains all the same functions as a regular contract but features an added verify transaction. In this optional step, we'll take a look at the differences between transactions on the `Default Smart Contract` and the `Private Data Contract`, focusing on the new transaction – `verifyPrivateAsset()`.

The main CRUD (`create`, `read`, `update` and `delete`) functions along with the `Exists` function do exactly as their names suggest.

In a `Default Smart Contract`, the functions appear as `createAsset()` or `deleteAsset()`. But in a Private Data Contract, they appear as;

`createMyPrivateAsset()`

`readMyPrivateAsset()`

`updateMyPrivateAsset()`

`deleteMyPrivateAsset()`

`privateMyAssetExists()`

The functions are discussed at length in the Introductory Series, so we recommend going and having a look at Step 2: Understand the smart contract (optional) in Tutorial 1: Local Smart Contract Development, if you feel like you need to refresh your memory on what these transactions do. However, there are a couple of small differences between how some of these transactions work on the `Default Smart Contract` and the `Private Data Contract` you have created.

Unlike the `create` and `update` transactions in the `Default Smart Contract`, the `create` and `update` transactions in the `Private Data Contract` make use of transient data, which you would provide when you submit one of these transactions. Transient data is temporary and local to a peer, so it is perfect for passing private data into a transaction. These features mean that any information provided as transient data will not be recorded on the public ledger.

The `verifyMyPrivateAsset` transaction can be used to verify if a given set of private data exists.

    @Transactions(false)

    public async verifyMyPrivateAsset(ctx: Context, myPrivateAssetId:   string, objectToVerify: MyPrivateAsset): Promise<boolean>

This transaction requires two arguments – `myPrivateAssetId` and the `objectToVerify` (made up of a key/value pair). The `myPrivateAssetId` is simply the key that was used when saving the private data (supplied when passing in transient data) to the Private Data Collection. The object key and value will appear in the format `{"key":value"}`. For example, if Alice stores some private data `{"myPrivateValue":"50"}` in her Private Data Collection which only she has access to but wants to prove to Bob that it exists, Bob would use the verify transaction to confirm whether Alice is telling the truth or not. Bob can now submit the `verifyPrivateAsset()` transaction with the arguments: `asset ID` which is on the public ledger as `myPrivateAssetID` and the object `{"myPrivateValue":"50"}`. If Alice provided the correct data, the transaction should return true as the hash provided matches the hash stored on the public ledger. We will look at this in more detail later.

Notice the lines that start with `@Transaction()`. These come before each function in the generated `Private Data Contract` and they define the preceding transaction to be a callable transaction function. `@Transaction()` takes a boolean parameter where `true` indicates that the function is intended to be called using  `submit` and `false` indicates that the function is intended to be called using `evaluate`, with the default being set to true. The differences between `@Transaction()` and `@Transaction(false)` is especially important when it comes to the `readMyPrivateAsset()` transaction. A `Submit transaction` MUST NOT be performed on the `readMyPrivateAsset()`transaction. Doing so would result in the returned private data being submitted to the public ledger.

It is also worth having a look at the collections.json file at the root of the file directory for your project. Collections.json is the file that defines information such as who can persist data, how long private data is stored in a private database and the number of peers required for disseminating data – as well as how many it can be distributed to. Notice that the MSP ID is the one you specified when creating the project – whichever org is specified in the MSP ID is the one who can perform transactions.

<summary><b>3. Set up your 2 Org Local Fabric network</b></summary>

In this step, we will take you through the steps of creating a 2 org network. However, if you already have a 2 org network set up, feel free to use that instead.

> Note: If you use your own network, you will need to change the MSP ID in the collections.json file once the contract has been generated.

1. Hover over the `FABRIC ENVIRONMENTS` panel on the left hand side of the screen and select the +.
2. You will then be asked to `Select a method to add an environment`. Choose the `Create new from template` option.
3. From the list of network configuration options, choose the `2 Org template (2 CAs, 2 peers, 1 channel)`.
4. Give your network a name e.g. `newNetwork`. Whatever you find easy to identify! Then press `enter` which will trigger your network runtime to start.

After a few minutes, you will have your 2 org network ready to use your new Private Data Smart Contract on!

<summary><b>4. Package, install and instantiate the Private Data Smart Contract</b></summary>

The 3 necessary steps to run a smart contract on a blockchain network are;

1. Package the smart contract
2. Install the smart contract on Fabric peers using the package
3. Instantiate the smart contract on a Fabric channel

This extension allows you to do all these steps in 1 or follow the package, install and instantiate in separate steps. We will use the 1 step method as this process is covered in depth in the Introductory series.

1. Navigate to the `FABRIC ENVIRONMENTS` panel and select the network you created, so if you called it "newNetwork", select  `newNetwork o (click to start)` – this will start your local fabric environment. This may take a few minutes.
2. Once you've received a notification saying "Connected to Local Fabric", click `+ Instantiate` under `Smart Contracts > Instantiated`.
3. Firstly, you will be asked which peers you would like to instantiate the contract on, select both peers.
4. Then, select the smart contract you wish to instantiate onto the peers. Select the `privateContract` (or whichever contract name you used in Step 1!).
5. If you would like to call a function when instantiating, please enter it now, but this is not necessary for this tutorial – so feel free to press enter to move onto the next step.
6. You'll be asked if you would like to provide a Private data configuration file, click `Yes` and add in your
`collections.json` file from your `privateContract` folder. This `collections.json` file was created when you created your `Private Data Smart Contract`.
7. When asked for a smart contract endorsement policy, select `Default (single endorser, any org)`, unless you would like to specify an endorsement policy.
8. If you are using Typescript, you will `see privateContract@0.0.1` appear in the `SMART CONTRACTS` panel and under `Smart Contracts > Installed` in the `FABRIC ENVIRONMENTS`. Your project has been packaged using the information in `package.json` and installed on all peers in the network.

Once your smart contract is instantiated, you will receive a notification stating that the instantiation was successful, and `privateContract@0.0.1` will appear under `Smart Contracts > Instantiated`. This may take a couple of minutes, so please be patient!

<summary><b>5. Transact as Org1</b></summary>

In this step we will interact with the network as Org1 through a series of transactions. Providing the previous instructions have been followed correctly, all transactions should be successful as Org1 has access to the Private Data Collection.

> **Note:** When following the instructions below, do the following if you wish to use the command palette, otherwise ignore this and just follow the instructions below this note.
> 1. Enter `Submit Transaction` or `Evaluate Transaction` based on whether you intend to submit or evaluate a transaction.
> 2. You will then be asked to choose a gateway to connect with, select your new network, so `newNetwork – Org 1`, if that's what you called it.
> 3. Select the `org1Admin` identity when asked which identity to connect with.
> 4. Choose your private data smart contract from the list of smart contracts.
> 5. Finally, you will be asked which transaction to submit/evaluate. Select the relevant one. From here, the flow is the same as stated per instruction.


Let's start transacting!

1. Connect to `Org1` via the `newNetwork – Org1` gateway using the `admin` identity. To do this, select `newNetwork– Org1` under the `FABRIC GATEWAYS`and select `org1Admin`. Your Smart Contract should now be seen under `Channels > myChannel` in `FABRIC GATEWAYS`; if you select your smart contract then all the available transactions you can submit and evaluate will be there.

> Note: The extension will ask you to select a peer-targeting policy for this transaction after you've specified the transient data. We will use the default option for every transaction we submit. This is only mentioned in the following step so you are able to see where it fits in, but make sure you select default for every transaction.

2. Let's start off by creating an asset. Right click `createMyPrivateAsset` and click `Submit Transaction`. Enter in the argument `["001"]`– this is the `assetID`. Then enter in the transient data `{"privateValue":"150"}` – this is the private data, it states that the private value for asset 001, is 150. As mentioned above, you will now be asked to `Select a peer-targeting policy for this transaction`, select the `default` option. If your transaction was successful then the output should show `[TIMESTAMP] [SUCCESS] No value returned from createMyPrivateAsset`.

3. To check that the private data was stored, we will now evaluate `readMyPrivateAsset` transaction. Right click this transaction from the list under `FABRIC GATEWAYS > Channels > mychannel > privateContract` and click `Evaluate transaction`. Enter in the same argument as in the previous transaction; so `["001"]`. Do not enter in any transient data, instead just press enter. If the transaction was successful, the output will return `[TIMESTAMP] [SUCCESS] Returned value from readMyPrivateAsset: {"privateValue": "150"}`.

4. Now try submitting an `updateMyPrivateAsset` transaction to update some information about the asset. Right click `updateMyPrivateAsset` and click `Submit transaction`. Enter in the argument `["001"]` and change the transient data to be `{"privateValue":"125"}`. This will change the private value to be 125. The output should return `[TIMESTAMP] [SUCCESS] No value returned from updateMyPrivateAsset`.

Feel free to submit more transactions with the private asset; but the point is that Org1 has complete control over the asset and can see/change anything about said asset. Now let's see what happens when we connect to the network as Org2 and try to interact with the asset.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><b>6. Transact as Org2</b></summary>

In this step we will interact with the network as Org2 through a series of transactions. Providing the previous instructions have been followed correctly, all transactions (except `verifyMyPrivateAsset`) should be unsuccessful, as Org2 does not have access to the Private Data Collection.

1. Before connecting to the Org2 gateway, disconnect from Org1 by clicking the `disconnect` button on the top right of the gateways panel.

2. Connect to Org2 the same way you connected to Org1 previously. Select `newNetwork – Org2` under `FABRIC GATEWAYS` and select `org2Admin`. Now navigate to the list of available transactions for Org2 under `FABRIC GATEWAYS > Channels > mychannel`. This list of transactions will be the same as for Org1.

3. Org2 is able to see that Org1 created an asset with the asset ID of 001. So let's see what happens when Org2 tries to read the transaction. As in step 5.3, evaluate a `readMyPrivateAsset` transaction using the argument `["001"]` and no transient data. This will throw an error into your notifications and in the output.

4. What if Org2 wanted to create their own private asset? As in step 5.2, submit a `createMyPrivateAsset` transaction. As the asset ID 001 has already been used (when Org1 created their asset), enter `[002]` for the assetID. Enter `{"privateValue":"150"}` as the transient data, and choose default peer targeting. This transaction should then succeed with the output `[TIMESTAMP] [SUCCESS] No value returned from createMyPrivateAsset`.

It's likely that you were expecting this transaction to fail. Org2 wasn't able to read from Org1's private data collection, so why should it be able to write to it? 

Imagine that a transaction is sent to both Org1 and Org2 at the same time, in order to meet the endorsement policy. Both of the peers need write access to the same set of private data collections to achieve endorsement, otherwise there will be difference between the transactions signatures that Org1 and Org2 end up with. As such, Org2 is able to submit a `createMyPrivateAsset` transaction to Org1's private data collection without any issues.

You should now feel more comfortable with the differences between transacting as an organisation that is a member of a private data collection and one that isn't. But what if Org2 wanted to check what Org1 had stored in their private data collection with the permission of Org1?

<details>
<summary><b>7. Using the verify transaction to check what is stored in a Private Data Collection</b></summary>

So if Org2 was a regulatory body and wanted to make sure that Org1's private asset was legally sound; Org1 could tell Org2 what the original value of the asset was, and Org2 could run a verify transaction to confirm this. This is what we will do in this step; please remain connected to the Org2 Fabric Gateway. Before carrying out this step, let us give you a bit of information about the verify transaction. The function appears in the contract like this;

    @Transactions(false)

    public async verifyMyPrivateAsset(ctx: Context, myPrivateAssetId:   string, objectToVerify: MyPrivateAsset): Promise<boolean>

This shows that when the transaction is submitted, it is going to be looking for 2 arguments; the asset ID (`myPrivateAssetId`) and the object (`objectToVerify: MyPrivateAsset)`, where the object is made up of a key and a value.

Once submitted, the output will either return true or false. True if the arguments match the original values for the asset, false if the arguments do not match the original values for the asset.

1. Right click `verifyMyPrivateAsset` from the list of transactions and select `Submit transaction`. For the arguments enter `["001", {"privateValue": "125"}]`. This includes the asset ID and the private value of 125. Do not enter any transient data here. The output will return `[TIMESTAMP] [SUCCESS] Returned value from verifyMyPrivateAsset: true`. The `true` part of that expression confirms that the information provided by Org1 to Org2 was in fact correct.
2. Feel free to have a go at submitting a verify transaction with incorrect arguments to prove that the transaction would provide a different outcome across the output. For example, submit a `verifyMyPrivateAsset` transaction with the original arguments `["001", {"privateValue": "150"}]` because Org1 may have forgotten they previously updated the value! Obviously 150 is not the same as 125 so the output would return `[TIMESTAMP] [SUCCESS] Returned value from verifyMyPrivateAsset: false`.

Congratulations - you have successfully created a Private Data Smart Contract, transacted as an authorised organisation and an unauthorised organisation and been introduced to the verify transaction.
