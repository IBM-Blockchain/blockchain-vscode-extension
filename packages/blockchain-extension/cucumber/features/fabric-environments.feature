Feature: Fabric Environments
  Tests all the features of the fabric ops panel

  Scenario Outline: There should be a tree item (disconnected)
    Given the 1 Org Local Fabric environment is running
    Then there should be a tree item with a label '<label>' in the 'Fabric Environments' panel
    And the tree item should have a tooltip equal to '<tooltip>'
    Examples:
      | label                 | tooltip                                  |

    And the wallet 'myWallet' with identity 'conga' and mspid 'Org1MSP' exists
    And the environment is setup
    And the 'myFabric' environment is connected
    And a <language> smart contract for <assetType> assets with the name <name> and version <version>
    And a smart contract definition with the name <name> and version <version>
    And the contract has been created
    And the contract has been packaged
    And the contract has been deployed on channel 'mychannel'
    And a smart contract definition with the name <name> and version <version2>
    When I deploy the contract on channel 'mychannel' with sequence '2'
    Then there should be a committed smart contract tree item with a label '<committedName>' in the 'Fabric Environments' panel for item mychannel
    And the tree item should have a tooltip equal to '<committedName>'
    And the log should have been called with 'SUCCESS' and 'Successfully committed smart contract definition'
    Examples:
      | language   | assetType | name               | version | version2 | committedName            |
      | JavaScript | Conga     | JavaScriptContract | 0.0.1   | 0.0.2    | JavaScriptContract@0.0.2 |
