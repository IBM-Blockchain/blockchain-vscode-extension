Feature: Fabric Environments
    Tests all the features of the fabric ops panel

    Scenario Outline: There should be a tree item (disconnected)

        Then there should be a tree item with a label '<label>' in the 'Fabric Environments' panel
        And the tree item should have a tooltip equal to '<tooltip>'
        Examples:
        | label                     | tooltip                                  |
