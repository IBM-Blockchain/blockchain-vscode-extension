Feature: FabCar Sample
    Install and instantiate FabCar sample of all the languages supported

#     Scenario Outline: Clone the FabCar sample and package, install, instantiate it
#         Given I have cloned the repository 'fabric-samples' and I have opened the '<language>' '<sampleName>' contract called '<contractName>' with namespace '<namespace>'
#         And a 2 org local environment called '2 Org Network' has been created
#         And the 2 Org Network environment is running
#         And the 'Local Fabric Admin' identity
#         And the '2 Org Network' environment is connected
#         And the contract has been packaged
#         And I'm connected to the '2 Org Network - Org1' gateway
#         And the package has been installed
#         And the contract has been instantiated with the transaction '' and args '', not using private data on channel 'mychannel'
#         When I submit the transaction 'createCar' on the channel 'mychannel' with args '["123", "Tesla", "X", "Red", "Jack"]'
#         Then the logger should have been called with 'SUCCESS', 'Successfully submitted transaction' and 'No value returned from createCar'
#         Examples:
#         | language   | sampleName   | contractName               | namespace |
#         | JavaScript | FabCarjs     | fabcar-contract-javascript | FabCar    |
#         | TypeScript | FabCarts     | fabcar-contract-typescript | FabCar    |
#         | Java       | FabCarJava   | fabcar-contract-java       | FabCar    |
#         | Go         | FabCarGo     | fabcar-contract-go         | FabCar    |
