Feature: Upgrade Smart Contracts
  Test upgrading a smart contract

  @otherFabric
  Scenario Outline: It should change the packaged contract
    Given an environment 'myFabric' exists
    And the wallet 'myWallet' with identity 'conga' and mspid 'Org1MSP' exists
    And the environment is setup
    And the 'myFabric' environment is connected
    And a <language> smart contract for <assetType> assets with the name <name> and version <version>
    And a smart contract definition with the name <name> and version <version>
    And the contract has been created
    And the contract has been packaged
    And the contract has been deployed on channel 'mychannel'
    And the contract has been deleted
    And the package has been deleted
    And a <language> smart contract for <assetType2> assets with the name <name> and version <version>
    And a smart contract definition with the name <name> and version <version>
    And the contract has been created
    And the contract has been packaged
    When I deploy the contract on channel 'mychannel' with sequence '1'
    Then there should be a committed smart contract tree item with a label '<committedName>' in the 'Fabric Environments' panel for item mychannel
    And the tree item should have a tooltip equal to '<committedName>'
    And the log should have been called with 'SUCCESS' and 'Successfully approved smart contract definition'
    And the log should have been called with 'ERROR' and 'Failed to deploy smart contract, Could not commit smart contract definition'
    Examples:
      | language   | assetType | name               | assetType2 | version | committedName            |
      | JavaScript | Conga     | JavaScriptContract | CongaTwo   | 0.0.1   | JavaScriptContract@0.0.1 |
      | Java       | Conga     | JavaContract       | CongaTwo   | 0.0.1   | JavaContract@0.0.1       |
