Notes
---
* Connecting to IBM Blockchain Platform environments will not work yet as they are not using the new lifecycle yet.
* If you already have v1.4 local environment's running, you'll need to tear them down and start them again to use them as v2 local environments.
* Debug doesn't work at moment
