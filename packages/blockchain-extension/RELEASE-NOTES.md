# IBM Blockchain Platform Extension updated to v1.0.31
_Release date: May 26th 2020_

Announcements
---
* This version of the extension is a republish of our v1.0.30 release which didn't publish to the marketplace correctly.

* We’re still waiting for the gRPC v1.25.0 binaries to be published so you may be affected by [this issue](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/blockchain-vscode-extension/issues/1621), where gRPC fails to rebuild when using VS Code >1.40.x.
 > Please see [this comment](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/blockchain-vscode-extension/issues/1621#issuecomment-552926559) for a workaround.
