_Release date: June 25th 2020_

Announcements
---
* This is a duplicate of v2.0.0-beta.2 with a dependency fix.

* We welcome all feedback on this beta version so far. Please see the notes section for known issues.

* To install the extension, download the vsix file named `ibm-blockchain-platform-<VERSION>.vsix` from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/blockchain-vscode-extension/releases) page.
  In VS Code, switch to the Extensions view, click the hamburger menu and and select 'Install from VSIX'. Finally, select the downloaded vsix file. The extension should then install successfully.
  
* Weâ€™re still waiting for the gRPC v1.25.0 binaries to be published so you may be affected by [this issue](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/blockchain-vscode-extension/issues/1621), where gRPC fails to rebuild when using VS Code >1.40.x.
 > Please see [this comment](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/blockchain-vscode-extension/issues/1621#issuecomment-552926559) for a workaround.

Notes

* Connecting to IBM Blockchain Platform environments will not work yet as they are still using Fabric 1.4.

* Debug doesn't work at moment
